### Course
In this class, I learned the fundamentals of Machine Learning. The lectures consisted of mostly theory, 
while the homeworks focused on applying the theory using Python. The homeworks in this repository constitute the machine learning 
topics I have covered. The bolded items are the ones that I was responsible for writing.

### Homeworks
1. Decision Learning Algorithm
    * Information Gain Heuristic
    * __Variance Gain Heuristic__
2. Text Classification
    * __Text Mining/Cleaning__
    * __Naive Bayes__
    * Perceptron
    * Linear Regression
